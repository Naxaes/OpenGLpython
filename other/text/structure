**** RULES OF CONSISTENCY ****

    1.  Matrices that contain x number of vectors of length y should be defined with row as the number of vectors and
        column as the vector's length. This way, len(matrix) will return the number of vectors. Example:

            matrix = numpy.array((x, y), order='C')

    2.  Every module should define 4 globals with the following default values:
            CHECK_ERROR      = True
            CHECK_WARNING    = True
            CRASH_ON_ERROR   = True
            CRASH_ON_WARNING = False



Assets - Assets should be loaded to a global array, unless they are being streamed (such as music). Entities should have
         unsigned integers which represent the index of the asset in one of the arrays.

    * Models
    * Textures
    * Sounds



Entities:

    Attributes    |  Data type  |  Dependencies   |  Mask
                                                  |
    location      |  vec3       |                 |  DISPLACEMENT
    rotation      |  vec3       |  model          |  MODEL
    scale         |  vec3       |  model          |  MODEL
    model         |  uint       |  l, r, s        |  model
    color         |  vec3       |  model          |  model
    textures      |  uint       |  model
