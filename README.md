Fooling around with Python, pyglet and OpenGL. Check out tutorial for working step by step examples. The rest is most likely broken.

Documentation for pyglet: http://www.academia.edu/31359821/pyglet_Documentation_Release_1.2.4

TODO: For some of the tutorial examples, I have old NEW and CHANGED hanging around. They should be removed after each example.
