Rendering is done in three steps:
    1. Choose shader.
    2. Choose model.
    3. Choose texture.

Thus, entities needs to be sorted based on three categories:
    * Shader    - The shader that's going to render the entity.
    * Model     - The model that's going to be rendered by the shader.
    * Textures  - The textures of the model being rendered.

It should be trivial to get all entities for a specific shader/model/texture.
